# Overview
This project aims to analyze the trend in the homicide cases in Toronto. The dataset used for this project is extracted from
Open Data Toronto; cleaned and analyzed using R. The datase includes all reported homicide cases from 2004 to 2020.

This project focuses on three aspects of the homicide cases - the general trend of annual case number over the 17 years time span, the 
trend in its occurrence, observed by months and geographical location (represented by Toronto Police District), and the types of homicide. 

By investigating the trend in occurrence, I believe that the government will be able to better allocate its resource to prevent and react 
to homicide crimes in Toronto. Correponding policies can also be placed and reinforced based on the result.
